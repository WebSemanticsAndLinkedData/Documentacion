## HandsOn assignments

[Link to the repository of this assignment](https://github.com/WebServicesAndLinkedData/HandsOn)

In this repository the HandsOn group must submit their projects in a directory named **GroupXX** being "XX" the number with **two digits** of the group. It is recommended to follow the template uploaded in the directory **GroupTemplate**.

Additionally, the group can modify the test files in their own directory of the project which will test the dataset included in the *data* folder on each pull-request, or modify their tests as they wish.

### Tests:
The following checks will always be tested when making a pull-request:
* The directory of the group exists
* (Only the group uploading) The project files compile correctly
* (Only the group uploading) The JUnit tests pass correctly
