## Assignment 1

[Link to the repository of this assignment](https://github.com/WebSemanticsAndLinkedData/Assignment1)

Introduction assignment. The file to be uploaded is a csv file with **THREE** fields, your github username, your registration number (n√∫mero de matricula) in the university, and your email. The file has to be called **yourGithubUsername.csv**.

Example:
```
William, 170225, william.phips@gmail.com
```

If you already know it, add your github username and the **TWO DIGITS** of your group number to the HandsOn.csv file.

Example:
```
William, 07
```

This file will be used to identify your uploads so its **VERY** important to make sure the contents are correct. In this file reports will also be written recording the assignments you delivered and information about them.

### Tests:
The following checks will always be tested when making a pull-request:
* The student csv file exists and it is named correctly
* The student csv file has the correct number of fields
* The HandsOn csv file has the correct number of fields
